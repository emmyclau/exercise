# Data Scientist Take Home Exercise 

This exercise consists of 2 parts:
1. Statistics: Use crime dataset to understand the determinants of crime and to generate policy suggestions that are applicable to local government.
2. Machine Learning: 
3. Text Analysis (Bonus): Use review dataset to understand topics that users mention in dental reviews. 

**NOTE**
1. This exercise is meant to understand the approach and the logic than the actual performance of your models.  
2. Please use R or Python or both for this exercise.


## 1. Statistics

The file ```crime.csv``` is a dataset of crime statistics for a selection of counties.  Your task is to examine the data to help a campaign understand the determinants of crime and generate policy suggestions to local government to reduce crime.

|variable | label  |
|----------|--------|
|county|county identifier|
|year|1988|
|crime|crimes committed per person|
|probarr |‘probability’ of arrest|
|probconv |‘probability’ of conviction|
|probsen |‘probability’ of prison sentence|
|avgsen|avg. sentence, days|
|police|police per capita|
|density |people per sq. mile|
|tax|tax revenue per capita|
|west|=1 if in western part of the state|
|central |=1 if in central part of the state|
|urban |=1 if in Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area| 
|wagecon |weekly wage, construction|
|wagetrd |weekly wage, wholesle, retail trade|
|wageser |weekly wage, service industry|
|wagemfg |weekly wage, manufacturing|
|wageloc |weekly wage, local government employees|

Please prepare an analysis investigating the determinants of crime and addressing the concerns of the political campaign.  Please provide the data analysis, model specifications and your policy suggestions. 


## 2. Machine Learning

The ```news.csv``` is a dataset of newsgroup postings on a variety of topics.  Your task is to distinguish the posts between the topics based on the text of the posts.



## 3. Text Analysis (Bonus)

The ```review.csv``` is a dataset of user reviews for a selection of dentists.  Your task is to identify the main topics that users usually mention in the dental reviews.  It is similar to hotel reviews where users usually mention topics such as, "Room", "Location", "Price", "Service" of their hotel experience. 

Please provide the model source code and brief comment of the source code.
